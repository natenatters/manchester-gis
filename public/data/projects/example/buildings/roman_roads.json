  "notes": "Four major Roman roads radiated from Mamucium (Roman Manchester) fort in Castlefield, founded c. AD 79. The roads formed part of the Roman military infrastructure in northern Britain:\n\n1. ROAD TO RIBCHESTER (Margary 7b, 26.5 miles north): Ran along modern Deansgate, through Prestwich (later Bury Old Road), crossing the River Irwell at Radcliffe, continuing via Affetside to Bremetennacum (Ribchester). Featured long military sighting alignments. Surviving agger visible at Whitefield Golf Course and Withins Reservoir. A fortlet at Wayoh Bridge (14 miles from Manchester) shows continued military presence.\n\n2. ROAD TO YORK (Margary 712, 13.5 miles east): Part of the Chester-York highway, 'probably the most important road in northern England'. Exited via Store Street with long straight alignment to High Moor, Oldham. Preserved in Briscoe Lane, Roman Road, The Street, and Honeywell Lane. Connected to Castleshaw fort and continued east toward Eboracum (York). Built c. AD 80.\n\n3. ROAD TO CHESTER (Margary 7a, 20 miles south): Major highway to Deva Victrix (Chester). Crossed River Medlock at Knott Mill, passed through Stretford ('street ford' - named for the Roman road), Sale (Washway Road), Altrincham, to Condate (Northwich) and Chester. Modern Chester Road preserves much of the alignment. The 'Great Stone' in Stretford may be a Roman marker.\n\n4. ROAD TO WIGAN (Margary 702, 17 miles west): Connected to Coccium (Wigan), confirmed by excavations at Ellesmere Park (2005), Worsley (1984), and Wentworth School (2013). Road measured 23 feet wide with double ditches. Ran via Hope Hall, Worsley, Tyldesley, to Wigan. Distance matches Antonine Itinerary (17 Roman miles).\n\nThese roads were built using military planning with straight alignments between high points. The agger (raised road bed) was typically cambered for drainage with flanking ditches. Many sections remain visible via LIDAR imagery and are preserved in modern road alignments. Archaeological excavations have confirmed road construction: stone foundations, gravel surfaces, and engineering techniques including zig-zag patterns to manage steep gradients."
